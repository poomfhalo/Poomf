GUIDE:
Albedo Texture - self explanatory
Normal Map Texture - also self explanatory
Culling Mode - Select from one of 3 culling modes
A2C - Alpha to Coverage (or Alpha to Mask). Helps with aliasing in some cases, however does not work well with real-time shadows.
Normal intensity slider - determine the strength of the normal map
Cutoff - self explanatory
Smoothness - the roughness/smoothness of the surface
Metallic - how metallic the surface is
Speed - the speed of the wind effect
Amount - the distance between the sine waves, or simply put, the amount of varied movement the surface makes
Distance - the strength of the wind, or it's ability to bend the surface
Z Motion - by default the wind is applied to the global X axis, this applies it to the Z axis as well
Z Motion Speed - how quickly the wind changes direction from X to Z axis
Origin weight - it allows to prevent any unwanted movement at the base of the mesh (it's based on the height distance from the origin)
